# deathchat
a chatroom where you can only send death threats, this will be validated by an ai that rejects your message if it isn't a death threat

the frontend is in `frontend/` :exploding_head:
this should be built as a static export and put in a folder `public/` in the backend.

the backend is in `backend/` :exploding_head:
this can be deployed with scripts/deploy.sh or something idk its 1:30am

why is there no database you ask?\
well the type of messages on here shouldn't and won't be stored\
that's all ill say
